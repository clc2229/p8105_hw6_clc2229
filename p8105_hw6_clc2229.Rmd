### Problem 1

```{r}
homicides = read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")

homicides = 
  homicides %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", "),
         solved_bin = case_when(
           disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
           disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "Unsolved",
           disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "Solved"
         ),
         solved_bin = as.factor(solved_bin)
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Dallas, TX" & city_state != "Phoenix, AZ" & city_state != "Kansas City, MO" & city_state != "Tulsa, AL")
